Reads were classified to taxonomic units with Kraken_. This table provides the following columns:

1. Percentage of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
2. Number of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
3. Number of fragments assigned directly to this taxon
4. A rank code, indicating (U)nclassified, (R)oot, (D)omain, (K)ingdom,
   (P)hylum, (C)lass, (O)rder, (F)amily, (G)enus, or (S)pecies.
   Taxa that are not at any of these 10 ranks have a rank code that is
   formed by using the rank code of the closest ancestor rank with
   a number indicating the distance from that rank.  E.g., "G2" is a
   rank code indicating a taxon is between genus and species and the
   grandparent taxon is at the genus rank.
5. NCBI taxonomic ID number
6. Indented scientific name
